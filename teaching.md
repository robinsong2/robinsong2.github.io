I have taken great pleasure in teaching maths whenever I've had the opportunity over the last 10 years. This includes:
- private tutoring for all levels - my youngest students were an exceptional trio of yr 6 students at a primary school local to where I grew up, and at the more advanced level I've taken on a number of Masters students to help them through finals exams;
- a year as college tutor at [Wadham college](https://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/) giving ~10hrs of tutorials per week on the undergraduate syllabus as well as revision classes, pastoral care and admissions interviews;
- giving lectures and seminars during my time as a PhD student at Oxford (some of which can be found on my [About](/about/) page).

I am still available for private tutoring. If you want to contact me about doing some, then please email me at [this address](mailto:george.r.maths@gmail.com).
