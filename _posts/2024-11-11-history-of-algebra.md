This post is the second of a 3 part series:
1. In the [first post]({% post_url 2024-11-04-what-is-an-algebra %}) we discussed what algebra is, and how that relates to the notion of 'an algebra'. 
2. Here, we will discuss the historical development of algebra, and some of the problems it was used for.
3. [Finally]({% post_url 2024-11-18-modern-algebra %}), we will discuss the usage of algebra in modern mathematics, and see how wide ranging it really is as a subject.

Things to look into:
[Moderne Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderne_Algebra)
[History of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_algebra)
[Al-Jabr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jabr)

(abstract happens in 1920-1940) (dunno about chinese/indian maths)
- Ahmes papyrus (problem 24: value of heap if heap and 1/7 of heap is 19)
	- Take a guess at the solution (guess 7, so answer is 8 not 19). Then "divide", but they expressed them in terms of egyptian fractions so 19/8 was just identified as 2+1/4+1/8, then need to multiply this by initial guess, i.e. 7.
	- [Egyptian calculations](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/groups/education/pmej/pome12/article13.htm#:~:text=Aha%20in%20Egyptian%20means%20%22something,Cf.%2C%20Wilson%2C%20p.)
- Babylonians start factorising and moving like terms around
- Did Euclid use notation or words?
- Diophantus is start of using notation (not equals sign) e.g. Del^gamma is the square and K^gamma is the cube etc. 
	- It's a book that uses algebraic notation but not an algebra book
- Al-kwarizmi (algebraic notation but not like ours, but algebra for its own sake)
- Descartes, La Geometrie is pretty much our algebraic notation [La Geometrie](https://download.tuxfamily.org/openmathdep/geometry_analytic/The_Geometry-Descartes.pdf)
- Look at van der Waarden's modern algebra
- definitely reference Noether and Hilbert and emil Artin
- Hilbert's zahlbericht
- Leonard Dickson defined linear associative algebra
- Wedderburn next level of abstraction
- Noether invents ring theory? and zariski topology?
- Could mention homological algebra comes in the 50s but is beyond our purpose here
