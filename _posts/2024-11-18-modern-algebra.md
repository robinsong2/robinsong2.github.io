This post is the final installment of a 3 part series:
1. In the [first post]({% post_url 2024-11-04-what-is-an-algebra %}), we discussed what algebra is, and how that relates to the notion of 'an algebra'. 
2. In the [second post]({% post_url 2024-11-11-history-of-algebra %}), we discussed the historical development of algebra, and some of the problems it was used for.
3. Today, we will discuss the usage of algebra in modern mathematics, and see how wide ranging it really is as a subject.
