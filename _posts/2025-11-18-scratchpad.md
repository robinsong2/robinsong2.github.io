Look at ICM talks

Concepts
- Groups (including frieze and art)
- Categories
- Vector spaces (in particular how then arose/were originally thought of/recursion relations)
- Representations especially Galois
- Invariants/Noether's theorems
- Class Groups

Historical
- How did p-adics arise?
- What was Descartes doing when he invented coordinates?
- Topology, point set and algebraic (Emmy Noether appears in start of algebraic top)
- What was Hilbert doing invariant theory for (something to do with Paul Gordan?)
- Development of infinity (or possibly of induction)

Modern
- Drinfeld spaces & BT buildings
- Langlands' observations leading to conjectures (kinda historical)
