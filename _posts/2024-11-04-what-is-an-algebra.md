This post is the first of a 3 part series:
1. Here, we will discuss what algebra is, and how that relates to the notion of 'an algebra'. 
2. In the [second post]({% post_url 2024-11-11-history-of-algebra %}), we will discuss the historical development of algebra, and some of the problems it was used for.
3. [Finally]({% post_url 2024-11-18-modern-algebra %}), we will discuss the usage of algebra in modern mathematics, and see how wide ranging it really is as a subject.

But first, let's start at the beginning:

# Algebra - The Method

Consider the following sad anecdote:[^2]

> He was a boy for a sixth of his life, and then an extra twelfth. After a further seventh he married and five years after marriage had a son. The son sadly passes away upon reaching only half his father's lifespan, and after four years of grief the father also passes.

How old is the man in the anecdote?

> This is very much a classic high-school question, so let's do it. Let $x$ be the father's age when he dies. Then the story tells us that
> $$
> \frac{1}{6}x+\frac{1}{12}x+\frac{1}{7}x+5+\frac{1}{2}x+4=x.
> $$
> We follow our training, collect the $x$'s,

> 9 = \left(1-\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{12}-\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{2}\right)x = \frac{84-14-7-12-42}{84}x = \frac{9}{84}x,
> $$
> and so lo and behold $x=84$ after cancelling the $9$'s and multiplying by $84$.

[^1]: I try not to mention 'an algebra' in discussions, but anyone who has taken a glance at my actual work always brings this up.
[^2]: This is a puzzle purportedly referring to Diophantus of Alexandria - a key figure in the development of algebra that we will come across again later.
