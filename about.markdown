I am an AI Safety Researcher working for the [Alignment Research Center](https://www.alignment.org/). I live and work remotely in London, but visit Berkeley occasionally. 

Prior to working for ARC, I did a PhD from 2019-2024 at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof Sir Andrew Wiles. My main mathematical interest is number theory - specifically Iwasawa theory, the Langlands program and p-adic L-functions. My thesis was on equidistribution problems over totally real fields.

I did my undergraduate and masters degrees in Mathematics at Cambridge University, where I was a member of Gonville & Caius College.
## Mathematics

By far the most important thing I've written is my [My PhD Thesis](/pdfs/Thesis.pdf), submitted in May 2024.

Some talks I've given:

[An introductory talk to a seminar on the Langlands Program](/pdfs/LanglandsSeminarIntro.pdf)

[A talk on Galois representations coming from automorphic representations](/pdfs/GaloisRepsFromAutoReps.pdf)

[A talk on the Fargues-Fontaine Curve](/pdfs/TheCurve.pdf)
